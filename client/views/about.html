    <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
      When we first started coding, we were told that it was 30% planning, 40%
      implementing, and 30% debugging.  After working at it for a couple years,
      I realized that the reality is that programming is 95% Googling shit.
      Code Coach is a programming environment that acknowledges that fact and
      includes seeking help as a first-class feature.
